# Content Management Workflow Guide

## Introduction

This guide outlines the complete workflow for managing content in the Alessandro Aprile Portfolio application. We've designed these processes to ensure content quality, maintain consistency, and provide a smooth experience for content creators while preserving the technical integrity of the application.

## Content Creation Process

### Preparing New Content

When creating new content, we follow a structured approach that ensures consistency and maintainability. Let's walk through the process step by step:

1. **Planning**
   First, identify the type of content you're creating. Our portfolio supports several content types:
   - Project descriptions
   - Technical skills
   - Work experiences
   - Blog posts (if enabled)

2. **Content Structure**
   Each content type has a specific structure. For example, a project entry should include:
   ```markdown
   # Project Title
   
   ## Overview
   Brief description of the project
   
   ## Technical Details
   - Technology stack
   - Architecture highlights
   - Special features
   
   ## Challenges and Solutions
   Discussion of technical challenges
   
   ## Results
   Outcomes and achievements
   ```

### Content Creation Workflow

We follow a git-based workflow for content management:

1. **Branch Creation**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b content/project-name
   ```

2. **Content Addition**
   ```bash
   # For a new project
   cd content/projects
   touch new-project-name.md
   ```

3. **Content Validation**
   Before committing, validate your content:
   ```bash
   npm run validate-content
   ```

4. **Review Process**
   Create a pull request with your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "content: add new project description"
   git push origin content/project-name
   ```

## Content Update Workflow

When updating existing content, follow these steps to ensure smooth updates:

1. **Identify Content**
   Locate the content file you need to update:
   ```bash
   find content/ -name "*search-term*"
   ```

2. **Create Update Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b update/content-name
   ```

3. **Make Changes**
   Update the content following our structured format.

4. **Validate Changes**
   Run validation tests:
   ```bash
   npm run validate-content
   ```

## Content Organization

We maintain a clear structure for our content:

```
content/
├── projects/
│   ├── active/
│   └── archived/
├── skills/
│   ├── technical/
│   └── soft/
└── experiences/
    ├── current/
    └── past/
```

## Media Management

When working with media assets:

1. **Image Preparation**
   - Use descriptive filenames
   - Optimize images before upload
   - Follow our naming convention: `{content-type}-{descriptor}-{size}.{ext}`

2. **Asset Storage**
   Store media in the appropriate directory:
   ```
   assets/
   ├── images/
   │   ├── projects/
   │   └── profile/
   └── documents/
   ```

## Content Review Guidelines

We maintain high standards through our review process:

1. **Technical Review**
   - Verify all links work
   - Check image optimizations
   - Validate against schema
   - Ensure proper formatting

2. **Content Review**
   - Check for technical accuracy
   - Verify consistency with portfolio tone
   - Review grammar and spelling
   - Ensure completeness

## Deployment Process

Content goes through several stages before publication:

1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Content is deployed to staging environment
   - Visual verification performed
   - Interactive elements tested

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Content reviewed in staging
   - Final approval obtained
   - Deployment scheduled
   - Cache cleared post-deployment

## Maintenance Guidelines

Regular maintenance tasks ensure content quality:

1. **Monthly Review**
   - Check for outdated information
   - Verify all links
   - Update timestamps
   - Review analytics

2. **Quarterly Cleanup**
   - Archive outdated content
   - Update technology references
   - Refresh media assets
   - Update skill ratings

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Schema Validation Errors**
   ```bash
   # Check schema errors
   npm run validate-content -- --verbose
   ```

2. **Media Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify media references
   npm run check-media
   ```

3. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Clean and rebuild
   npm run clean
   npm run build
   ```

## Best Practices

Following these practices ensures smooth content management:

1. **Commit Messages**
   Use descriptive commit messages:
   ```
   content(projects): add new fullstack application project
   
   - Add project description
   - Include technical details
   - Add performance metrics
   ```

2. **Branch Management**
   Keep content branches focused and short-lived:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b content/specific-update
   ```

3. **Documentation**
   Document special requirements or considerations in content files:
   ```markdown
   ---
   requires: webgl
   complexity: advanced
   lastUpdated: 2024-11-30
   ---
   ```

## Emergency Procedures

In case of urgent content issues:

1. **Content Rollback**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Quick Fixes**
   For critical updates:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/content-fix
   # make changes
   git commit -m "fix(content): correct critical information"
   ```
